peak_memusage \- \fCpeak_memusage\fP - Determine the high-water mark memory usage of an application\&.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
peak_memusage determines the high-water mark of an application's memory usage\&.
.PP
This utility is a wrapper around \fCgetrusage\fP, which reports peak memory use of any executable\&. It is OpenMP and MPI aware and tries to report thread- and task- specific data\&. Of course, being OpenMP shared memory, that report cannot really separate thread-specific memory use\&.
.PP
Note that the memory usage is reported only at the end of the run\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The peak_memusage does not take any options\&.
